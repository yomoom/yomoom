--->Howdy I'm yomoom there isn't a lot of things I could say about myself besides my desire to try new things.
Moreover if I mention the things I'm interested in, i'm interested in learning code and being able to someday do something with it such as developing an app or something on that matter.
I've been learning HTML on my own for a while but currently i'm trying to get a hold of CSS, however I haven't really been active a lot per say in coding, might have to learn some things again.
Idk if I'll ever collaborate with anyone since it's not like I'm planning to use coding in an everyday matter but more or less just as a hobby.
well you can contact me thru my gmail : paulrofriguez04@gmail.com / twitter : @cakemoom and that's about it.
